// This pseudocode should determine and output the rental fees for cars.
// Standard cars rent for $65 per day, compacts rent for $40 per day,
// and subcompacts rent for $30 per day. Rentals for at least 7 days
// receive a 20% discount. An error message is displayed if the car type
// is not valid.

// NOTE: when things after a () is used, it means       that the code running under that function is         ran...ie if the getReady() function is called        between the start and end part of the pseduocode,    then these two lines:

   output Enter car type or , QUIT, to quit
   input carType

// will run!
